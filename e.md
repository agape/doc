1.	아타나시우스(Athanasius): “He became incarnate for our sakes, so that he might offer himself to the Father in our place, and redeem us through his offering and sacrifice. … This is he who, in former times, was sacrificed as a lamb, having been foreshadowed in that lamb.”
2.	그분은 우리를 위해 육체가 가진 존재를 되었다, 되어 우리를 대신하여 아버지 께 자신을 바칠 수있게 하셨으며, 그분의 제물과 희생을 통해 우리를 구속하셨습니다. … 이것은 이전에는 어린 양으로 희생되어 그 어린 양에 예표 된 사람입니다.”
그가 육체가 가진 존재를 되었다
우리 
우리 자리에 일종의 희생제물

3.	루피누스(Rufinus of Aquileia): “[The purpose of the Incarnation] was that the divine virtue of the Son of God might be like a kind of hook hidden beneath the form of human flesh … to lure on the prince of this world to a contest; that the Son might offer him his human flesh as a bait that the divinity which lay underneath might catch him and hold him fast with its hook. … Then, just as a fish when it seizes a baited hook not only fails to drag off the bait but is itself dragged out of the water to serve as food for others; so that he that had the power of death seized the body of Jesus in death, unaware of the hook of divinity which lay hidden inside. Having swallowed it, he was immediately caught. The gates of hell were broken, and he was, as it were, drawn up from the pit, to become food for others.”
