Offers a really compelling way of reading the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible. Levenson takes two primary motifs--Sinai and Zion--and uses them to illuminate what's going on in the canonical books. One of those works that prevent you from ever reading certain texts in the same old way again. Levenson's perspective as an Orthodox Jew can energize Christian readings.



Levenson presents an excellent introduction to the Jewish faith as it is represented in scripture. In Sinai & Zion he takes a clear look at the two mountains and the traditions which arose from Jewish experience of them and details their symbolism, meaning, and theological trends which arose: Sinai, the mountain of the conditional covenant, Moses, and the twelve tribes and the complex relationship it has to Zion, the mountain of David, the unconditional covenant, and the southern monarchy. 

He offers a detailed analysis of their relationship, the subtleties of their interactions, and a needed corrective to a predominant view of biblical Judaism by contemporary christian scholars, theologians and many lay people. 



first read this classic, I believe, while I was taking Jon Levenson’s course on Genesis at Harvard Div School. Reading it, and teaching it again this season in my “Intro Bible” course I’m appreciating its difficulty and brilliance. I had forgotten how much this book is slalom run of polemics against Protestant scholars who had been reading the O.T. through a Christian theological lens. There are long stretches of confusing disquisition on Hebrew words, toggling between familiar stories (Genesis, Exodus) and unfamiliar Israelite politics. Yet his hard-won conclusions are worth the slog. On this reading, I’ve noticed that Levenson’s ingenious reading—philological, literary, theological—is shaped by another polemic: the centrality of mitzvot. By framing O.T. as a tension between two 'mountain' traditions: the law from Sinai (audial) and the kingship at Zion (visual), Levenson has laid out a stimulating view. Has some contemporary Jewish thinker integrated his conclusions into a theology? 



This was not quite as accessible as I would have liked, but it covers some profound material.

Its three main sections deal with (1) Sinai, the origin of the covenant identity of Israel, (2) Zion, the prototypical society capable of communion with God, centered around the Jerusalem temple, and (3) the interplay between the two, they being complementary poles on a single axis.

It is perhaps no wonder that two of the most prominent old testament figures, namely Moses and David, each have their own covenant, each grounded on these opposite poles. Navigating the space from, to, and in between Sinai and Zion seems to be the foundation of the Jewish experience, and is notably also the groundwork for contextualizing Christ and the new covenant, as well as a major portion of latter-day saint theology.
